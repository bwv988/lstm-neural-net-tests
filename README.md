# Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks and Time Series Data

Quick explorations on applying LSTMs to time series data using Keras.


## Quickstart

### Run and view on Kaggle

https://www.kaggle.com/ternaryrealm/lstm-time-series-explorations-with-keras

### View in GitHub

https://github.com/bwv988/lstm-neural-net-tests/blob/master/notebooks/notebook.ipynb

### Run and edit locally 

This executes in Kaggle's Python container. Downloading the container will take some time. ;)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Navigate to: http://localhost:28889/notebooks/notebook.ipynb
